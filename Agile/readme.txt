This project addresses the need for consumable and engaging access to learning experiences to help people learn new skills and prepare for new careers and opportunities. We will be working on the IBM https://skillsbuild.org/ website.

The goal is to produce shorter development cycles and more frequent product releases than traditional waterfall project management.
